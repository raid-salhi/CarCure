    <string name="cause">Worn brake pads are typically the cause of both these symptoms. Brake pads are designed to wear down over time as they create friction against the brake rotors to slow or stop the vehicle. As the pads wear, they become thinner, and eventually, the wear indicators or the metal backing of the pads can make contact with the rotor, causing noise and reducing braking effectiveness.</string>
